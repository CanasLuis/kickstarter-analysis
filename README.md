# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose

With a database given, the pourpose is to undesrtand how are the fundraising behaving in terms of having success, fail, or being cancelled. We can study the goals amount and the types of each one of them and determine factors of success.


## Analysis and Challenges
As mentioned, the given information contains detail of each fundraising like name, dates, goal, pledge, country, etc. As follows:



The month with most successful fundraisings is May, showing a big increase from Apr, with 40 succesful cases. In addition, failed and canceled fundraisings didn´t grow that much, from April to May. 
Biggest number of failed cases happened in Oct, despite of that, this is the only month with no canceled campaings.

The campaing with the highest percentage funded had a goal of 1.00 USD, and pledged more thatn 22 thousand USD




### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

December was the worst month for campaings, with almost the same successful cases than failed ones. In total, failed plus canceled are more than the successful ones
36% of the fundairisng campaings failed during the year, having just a rate of success of 61%



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

None of the campaings with subcategory play was canceled. in addition, the campaings with a goal of less than 1000 have a higher successful rate.



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


Tha main challenges were using the dates, since the format wasn´t familiar for me in columns "deadline" and "launch date". 
Another potential challenge is to understando how to allocate the information in the pivot table in order to obtain the beest from it. 



## Results
campaings a
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

dates have to be modified in order to be readable. It would be helpful to understad the reasons of the canceled campaings in order to give more detail about what can make a successful fundraise
the category also has to be modified in order to have a better classification of the information. It is unclear what some information stands for, i.e. "Staff pick" and why aree some campaings with a goal of 1?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

a lot can be created using this information, we can obtain statistics using different types of sub categories. Countries with most campaings and with more and less success cases. 
what is the most attractive subcategory and how a higher goal amount is affecting the success or failure?
